These functions modify functions in R packages _MASS_ [Venables & Ripley 2012] and _mlogit_ [Croissant 2013] in order to implement **backward-step procedure** for multinomial logit models and estimate **point elasticities** in objects of class _mlogit_. An additional function is provided to perform **Dominance Analysis** on _mlogit_ models following the procedure described in Luchman [2014]. The modification for point elasticities was informed by this discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25831729/marginal-effects-of-mlogit-in-r
